Example PHP project
===================

The purpose of this repository is to show how to use Travis CI to do continuous integration with a PHP project.

Here is a sample status icon showing the state of the master branch:

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ensagen/php.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ensagen/php)

In order to run this project just fork it on github.com and then [enable](http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/getting-started/)
your fork on your [travis-ci profile](http://travis-ci.org/profile). Every push will then trigger a new build on Travis CI.
